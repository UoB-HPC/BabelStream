[![CI](https://github.com/UoB-HPC/BabelStream/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/UoB-HPC/BabelStream/actions/workflows/main.yaml)

Measure memory transfer rates to/from global device memory on GPUs.
This benchmark is similar in spirit, and based on, the STREAM benchmark [1] for CPUs.

Unlike other GPU memory bandwidth benchmarks this does *not* include the PCIe transfer time.

There are multiple implementations of this benchmark in a variety of [programming models](#models).

This code was previously called GPU-STREAM.

## Programming Models

BabelStream is currently implemented in the following parallel programming models, listed in no particular order:

- OpenCL
- CUDA
- HIP
- OpenACC
- OpenMP 3 and 4.5
- C++ Parallel STL
- Kokkos
- RAJA
- SYCL and SYCL2020 (USM and accessors)
- TBB
- Thrust (via CUDA or HIP)
- Futhark

This project also contains implementations in alternative languages with different build systems:
* Julia - [JuliaStream.jl](./src/julia/JuliaStream.jl)
* Java - [java-stream](./src/java/java-stream)
* Scala - [scala-stream](./src/scala/scala-stream)
* Rust - [rust-stream](./src/rust/rust-stream)

## How is this different to STREAM?

BabelStream implements the four main kernels of the STREAM benchmark (along with a dot product), but by utilising different programming models expands the platforms which the code can run beyond CPUs.

The key differences from STREAM are that:
* the arrays are allocated on the heap
* the problem size is unknown at compile time
* wider platform and programming model support

With stack arrays of known size at compile time, the compiler is able to align data and issue optimal instructions (such as non-temporal stores, remove peel/remainder vectorisation loops, etc.).
But this information is not typically available in real HPC codes today, where the problem size is read from the user at runtime.

BabelStream therefore provides a measure of what memory bandwidth performance can be attained (by a particular programming model) if you follow today's best parallel programming best practice.

BabelStream also includes the nstream kernel from the Parallel Research Kernels (PRK) project, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ParRes/Kernels).

## Building

Drivers, compiler and software applicable to whichever implementation you would like to build against is required.

### CMake

The project supports building with CMake >= 3.13.0, which can be installed without root via the [official script](https://cmake.org/download/).

Each BabelStream implementation (programming model) is built as follows:

```shell
$ cd babelstream

# configure the build, build type defaults to Release
# The -DMODEL flag is required
$ cmake -Bbuild -H. -DMODEL=<model> <model specific flags prefixed with -D...>

# compile
$ cmake --build build

# run executables in ./build
$ ./build/<model>-stream
```

The `MODEL` option selects one implementation of BabelStream to build.
The source for each model's implementations are located in `./src/<model>`.

Currently available models are:
```
omp;ocl;std-data;std-indices;std-ranges;hip;cuda;kokkos;sycl;sycl2020;acc;raja;tbb;thrust;futhark
```

#### Overriding default flags
By default, we have defined a set of optimal flags for known HPC compilers.
There are assigned those to `RELEASE_FLAGS`, and you can override them if required.

To find out what flag each model supports or requires, simply configure while only specifying the model.
For example:
```shell
> cd babelstream
> cmake -Bbuild -H. -DMODEL=ocl 
...
- Common Release flags are `-O3`, set RELEASE_FLAGS to override
-- CXX_EXTRA_FLAGS: 
        Appends to common compile flags. These will be used at link phase at well.
        To use separate flags at link time, set `CXX_EXTRA_LINKER_FLAGS`
-- CXX_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS: 
        Appends to link flags which appear *before* the objects.
        Do not use this for linking libraries, as the link line is order-dependent
-- CXX_EXTRA_LIBRARIES: 
        Append to link flags which appears *after* the objects.
        Use this for linking extra libraries (e.g `-lmylib`, or simply `mylib`) 
-- CXX_EXTRA_LINKER_FLAGS: 
        Append to linker flags (i.e GCC's `-Wl` or equivalent)
-- Available models:  omp;ocl;std;std20;hip;cuda;kokkos;sycl;acc;raja;tbb
-- Selected model  :  ocl
-- Supported flags:

   CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER (optional, default=c++): Any CXX compiler that is supported by CMake detection
   OpenCL_LIBRARY (optional, default=): Path to OpenCL library, usually called libOpenCL.so
...
```

Alternatively, refer to the [CI script](./src/ci-test-compile.sh), which test-compiles most of the models, and see which flags are used there.

*It is recommended that you delete the `build` directory when you change any of the build flags.*

### Spack


The project supports building with Spack >= 0.19.0, which can be installed without root via the [official GitHub repo](https://github.com/spack/spack).
The BabelStream Spack Package source code could be accessed from the link [here](https://github.com/spack/spack/tree/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/babelstream/package.py).
Each BabelStream implementation (programming model) is built as follows:

```shell

# Spack package installation starts with `spack install babelstream` for all programming models
# The programming model wish to be build needs to be specified with `+` option
# The model specific flags needs to be specified after defining model
$ spack install babelstream@<version>%<compiler> +<model> <model specific flags>


# The executables will be generated in:
# SPACK_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/opt/spack/system-name/compiler-name/babelstream-version-identifier/bin/
# this address will be printed at the end of generation which could be easily copied
$ cd SPACK_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/opt/spack/system-name/compiler-name/babelstream-version-identifier/bin/
$ ./<model>-stream
```
More detailed examples are provided in [Spack README file](./docs/spack_instructions.md).
The `MODEL` variant selects one implementation of BabelStream to build.

Currently available models are:
```
omp;ocl;std-data;std-indices;std-ranges;hip;cuda;kokkos;sycl;sycl2020-acc;sycl2020-usm;acc;raja;tbb;thrust
```

### GNU Make

Support for Make has been removed from 4.0 onwards.
However, as the build process only involves a few source files, the required compile commands can be extracted from the CI output.

<!-- TODO add CI snipped here -->

## Results

Sample results can be found in the `results` subdirectory.
